        "This tutorial details feature columns. Think of feature columns as the intermediaries between raw data and Estimators. Feature columns are very rich, enabling you to transform a diverse range of raw data into formats that Estimators can use, allowing easy experimentation.\n",

        "\n",
        "What kind of data can a deep neural network operate on? The answer is, of course, numbers (for example, tf.float32). After all, every neuron in a neural network performs multiplication and addition operations on weights and input data. Real-life input data, however, often contains non-numerical (categorical) data. For example, consider a product_class feature that can contain the following three non-numerical values:\n",
        "\n",
        "*  kitchenware\n",
        "* electronics\n",
        "* sports\n",
        "\n",
        "ML models generally represent categorical values as simple vectors in which a 1 represents the presence of a value and a 0 represents the absence of a value. For example, when product_class is set to sports, an ML model would usually represent product_class as [0, 0, 1], meaning:\n",

        " *  0: electronics is absent\n",
        " *  1: sports is present\n",

Well, notice that the categorization splits a single input number into a four-element vector. Therefore, the model now can learn four individual weights rather than just one; four weights creates a richer model than one weight. More importantly, bucketizing enables the model to clearly distinguish between different year categories since only one of the elements is set (1) and the other three elements are cleared (0). For example, when we just use a single number (a year) as input, a linear model can only learn a linear relationship. So, bucketing provides the model with additional flexibility that the model can use to learn.\n",

        "  * Feature names; that is, names from the dict returned from input_fn.\n",
        "  * Any categorical column, except categorical_column_with_hash_bucket (since crossed_column hashes the input).\n",
        "\n",
        "Except that a full grid would only be tractable for inputs with limited vocabularies. Instead of building this, potentially huge, table of inputs, the crossed_column only builds the number requested by the hash_bucket_size argument. The feature column assigns an example to a index by running a hash function on the tuple of inputs, followed by a modulo operation with hash_bucket_size.\n",
        "\n",
        "As discussed earlier, performing the hash and modulo function limits the number of categories, but can cause category collisions; that is, multiple (latitude, longitude) feature crosses will end up in the same hash bucket. In practice though, performing feature crosses still adds significant value to the learning capability of your models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Somewhat counterintuitively, when creating feature crosses, you typically still should include the original (uncrossed) features in your model (as in the preceding code snippet). The independent latitude and longitude features help the model distinguish between examples where a hash collision has occurred in the crossed feature."
